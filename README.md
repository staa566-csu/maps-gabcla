Map Assignment: 

Create a map. The map can display any data and message you want. Describe the following:

- data source
- spatial units being displayed
- what you are trying to communicate
- what decisions you made and why you made those to best communicate the data.
- Provide code and final figure on GitHub. Make sure your work can be replicated including pulling the data. If the work cannot be replicated give a short note explaining why (so we know you didnâ€™t just skip this part).

You are not limited to one map. You may make more than one map or include other figures to communicate the data. At least one figure needs to be a map.

You can make one html file in your repo that has your figure and your figure discussion.
